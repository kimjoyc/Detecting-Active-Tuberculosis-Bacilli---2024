# Evaluating a Deep Learning Model for TB Bacilli Detection

## Overview

This script evaluates a trained deep learning model on a holdout dataset to detect TB bacilli. It calculates evaluation metrics like **ROC-AUC** and **PR-AUC**, visualizes model performance through plots, and prepares holdout dataset predictions for further analysis or submission. Additionally, suggestions for improving model performance via fine-tuning are provided.

## Features

1. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Computes **ROC-AUC** and **PR-AUC** scores to evaluate classification performance.
   - Generates **ROC** and **Precision-Recall** curves for visual assessment.
   
2. **Holdout Dataset Processing**:
   - Preprocesses holdout dataset images for inference.
   - Generates prediction probabilities for the holdout dataset.
   - Saves the processed predictions in a CSV file for further use.

3. **Fine-Tuning Suggestions**:
   - Provides actionable recommendations for improving model performance.
